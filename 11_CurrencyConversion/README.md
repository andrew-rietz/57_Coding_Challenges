## 11 -- Currency Conversion
At some point, you might have to deal with
currency exchange rates, and you'll need to ensure
your calculations are as precise as possible.

Write a program that converts currency. Specifically,
convert euros to US dollars. Prompt for the amount
of money in euros you have, and prompt for the
current exchange rate of the euro. Print out the
new amount in US dollars. The formula for currency
conversion is:

`(amount_to) = ((amount_from) * (rate_from / rate_to))`

Where:
- `amount_to` is the amount in US dollars  
- `amount_from` is the amount in euros  
- `rate_from` is the current exchange rate in euros  
- `rate_to` is the current exchange rate of the dollar  

#### Example Output
How many euros are you exchanging? 81  
What is the exchange rate? 137.51  
81 euros at an exchange rate of 137.51 is 111.38 dollars
