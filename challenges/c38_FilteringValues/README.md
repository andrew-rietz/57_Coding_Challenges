## 38 -- Filtering Values
Sometimes input you collect will need to be filtered
down. Data structures and loops can make this
process easier.

Create a program that prompts for a list of numbers,
separated by spaces. Have the program print out a
new list containing only the even numbers.


#### Example Output
Enter a list of numbers, separated by spaces: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
The even numbers are 2 4 6 8.
