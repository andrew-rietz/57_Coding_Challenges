## 33 -- Magic 8 Ball
Arrays are great for storing possible responses from
a program. If you combine that with a random number
generator, you can pick a random entry from this list,
which works great for games.

Create a Magic 8 Ball game that prompts for a
question and then displays either 'Yes', 'No',
'Maybe', or 'Ask again later.'


#### Example Output
What's your question? Will I be rich and famous?
Ask again later.
