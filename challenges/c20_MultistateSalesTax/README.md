## 20 -- Multistate Sales Tax
More complex programs may have decisions nested in
other decisions, so that when one decision is made,
additional decisions must be made.

Create a tax calculator that handles multiple states
and multiple counties within each state. The program
prompts the user for the order amount and the state
where the order will be shipped.

For WI residents, prompt for the county of residence
 - For Eau Claire county, add an additional 0.005 tax
 - for Dunn county, add an additional 0.004 tax  

Illinois residents must be charged 8% sales tax with
no additional county-level charge. All other states
are not charged tax. The program then displays the
tax and the total for Wisconsin and Illinois
residents by just the total for everyone else.


#### Example Output
What is the order amount? 10  
What state do you live in? Wisconsin  
The tax is $0.50  
The total is $10.50
