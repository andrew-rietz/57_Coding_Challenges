## 25 -- Password Strength Indicator
Functions help you abstract away complex operations,
but they also help you build reusable components.

Create a program that determines the complexity of a
given password based on these rules:

- A very weak password contains only numbers and is
fewer than eight characters
- A weak password contains only letters and is fewer
than eight characters.
- A strong password contains letters and at least one
number and is at least eight characters.
- A very strong password contains letters, numbers,
and special characters and is at least eight
characters.


#### Example Output
The password '123456' is a very weak password.  
The password 'abcdef' is a weak password.  
The password 'abc123xyz' is a strong password.  
The password '1337h@xor!' is a very strong password.
