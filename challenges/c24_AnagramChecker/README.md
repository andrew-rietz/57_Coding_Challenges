## 24 -- Anagram Checker
Using functions to abstract the logic away from the
rest of your code makes it easier to read and easier
to maintain.

Create a program that compares two strings and
determines if the two strings are anagrams. The
program should prompt for both input strings and
display the output as shown in the example that
follows.


#### Example Output
Enter two strings and I'll tell you if they're anagrams:  
Enter the first string: note  
Enter the second string: tone  
"note" and "tone" are anagrams.
