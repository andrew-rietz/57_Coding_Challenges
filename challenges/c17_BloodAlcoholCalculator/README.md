## 17 -- Blood Alcohol Calculator
Sometimes you have to perform a more complex
calculation based on some provided inputs and then use
that result to make a determination.

Create a program that prompts for your weight, gender,
number of drinks, the amount of alcohol by volume of
the drinks consumed, and the amount of time since your
last drink. Calculate your blood alcohol content (BAC)
using this formula.

`BAC = (A * 5.14 / W * r) - 0.015 * H`

Where
`A` = total alcohol consumed in ounces  
`W` = body weight in pounds  
`r` = alcohol distribution ratio  (= 0.73 for men; = 0.66 for women)  
`H` = number of hours since the last drink  

Display whether or not it's legal to drive by
comparing the BAC to 0.08

#### Example Output
Your BAC is 0.08
It is not legal for you to drive.
