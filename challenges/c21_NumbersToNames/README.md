## 21 -- Numbers to Names
Many programs display information to the end user in
one form but use a different form inside the program.
For example, you may show the word 'Blue' on the
screen, but behind the scenes you'll have a numerical
value for that color or an internal value because you
may need to represent the textual description in
another language for Spanish-speaking visitors.

Write a program that converts a number from 1 to 12 to
the corresponding month. Prompt for a number and
display the corresponding calendar month, with 1 being
January and 12 being December. For any value outside
that range, display an appropriate error message.


#### Example Output
Please enter the number of the month:  
The name of the month is March.
