## 39 -- Sorting Records
When you're looking at results, you'll want to be
able to sort them so you can find what you're
looking for quickly or do some quick visual
comparisons.

Given the following data set (implemented as a list of dictionaries):

First Name          | Last Name           | Position            | Separation Date
--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------
John                | Johnson             | Manager             | 2016-12-31
Tuo                 | Xiong               | Software Engineer   | 2016-10-05
Michaela            | Michaelson          | District Manager    | 2015-12-19
Jake                | Jacobsen            | Programmer          |
Jacquelyn           | Jackson             | DBA                 |
Sally               | Weber               | Web Developer       | 2015-12-18

create a program that sorts all employees by last
name and prints them to the screen in a tabular
format.
