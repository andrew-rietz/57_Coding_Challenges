## 32 -- Guess the Number
Write a guess the number game that has three levels
of difficulty. The first level of difficult would
be a number between 1 and 10. The second difficulty
set would be between 1 and 100. The third difficulty
set would be between 1 and 1000.

Prompt for the difficult level, and then start the
game. The computer picks a random number in that
range and prompts the player to guess that number.

give the player a hint as to whether the number of
guesses. Once the player guesses the correct number,
the computer should present the number of guesses
