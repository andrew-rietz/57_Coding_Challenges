## 35 -- Picking a Winner
Arrays don't have to be hard-coded. You can take
user input and store it in an array and then work
with it.

Create a program that picks a winner for a contest or
prize drawing. Prompt for names of contestants until
the user leaves the entry blank. Then randomly
select a winner.


#### Example Output
Enter a name: Homer
Enter a name: Bart
Enter a name: Maggie
Enter a name: Lisa
Enter a name: Moe
Enter a name:
The winner is... Maggie.
