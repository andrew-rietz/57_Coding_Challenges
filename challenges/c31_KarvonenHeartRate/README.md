## 31 -- Karvonen Heart Rate
When you loop, you can control how much you increment
the counter; you don't always have to increment by
one.

When getting into a fitness program, you may want to
figure out your target heart rate so you don't
overexert yourself. The Karvonen heart rate formula
is on method you can use to determine your heart rate.
Create a program that prompts for your age and test
your resting heart rate. Use the Karvonen formula to
determine the target heart rate based on a range of
intensities from 55% to 95%. Generate a table with
the results as shown in the example output. The
formula is:

`targetHeartRate = (((220 - age) - restingHR) *
    Intensity) + restingHR`


#### Example Output
Resting Pulse: 65   Age: 22

Intensity       |  Rate
----------------|---------
55%             | 138 bpm
60%             | 145 bpm
65%             | 151 bpm
:               |   :       (extra lines omitted)
85%             | 178 bpm
90%             | 185 bpm
95%             | 191 bpm
