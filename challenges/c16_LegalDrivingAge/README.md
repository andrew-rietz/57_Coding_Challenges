## 16 -- Legal Driving Age
You can test for equality, but you may need to
test to see how a number compares to known value and
display a message if the number is too low or too
high.

Write a program that asks the user for their age and
compare it to the legal driving age of sixteen. If the
user is sixteen or older the program should display
"You are old enough to legally drive." If the user is
under sixteen, the program should display "You are
not old enough to legally drive."

#### Example Output
What is your age? 15  
You are not old enough to legally drive.  

**or**

What is your age? 35  
You are old enough to legally drive.

***
> Note: Added some additional functionality: The program will now check the user's age against the legal driving age in a given country.
