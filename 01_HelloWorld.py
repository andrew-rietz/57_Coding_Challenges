'''

The 'Hello, Word' program is the first program
you learn to write in many language, but it
doesn't involve any input.

So create a program that prompts for your name
and prints a greeting using your name

___________________
Example Output
___________________
What is your name? Brian
Hello, Brian, nice to meet you!

___________________
Constraint
___________________
Keep the input, string concatenation, and
output separate

'''

name = input('What is your name? ')
s = f'Hello, {name}, nice to meet you!'
print(s)
