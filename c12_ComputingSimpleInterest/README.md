## 12 -- Computing Simple Interest
Computing simple interest is a great way to quickly
figure out whether an investment has value. It's
also a good way to get comfortable with explicitly
coding the order of operations in your programs.

Create a program that computes simple interest.
Prompt for the principal amount, the rate as a
percentage, and the time, and display the
amount accrued (principal + interest).

The formula for simple interest is `A = P * (1 + r *t)`, where:
* `P` is the principal amount,
* `r` is the annual rate of interest,
* `t` is the number of years the amount is invested, and
* `A` is the amount at the end of the investment.

#### Example Output
Enter the principal: 1500  
Enter the rate of interest: 4.3  
Enter the number of years: 4

After 4 years at 4.3%, the investment will
be worth $1758.
