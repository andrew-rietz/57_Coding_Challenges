## 15 -- Password Validation
Passwords are validated by comparing a user-provided
value with a known value that's stored. Either it's
correct or it's not.

Create a simple program that validates user login
credentials. The program must prompt the user for a
username and password. The program should compare
the password given by the user to a known password.
If the password matches, the program should display
`"Welcome!"` If it didn't match, the program should
display `"I don't know you."`


#### Example Output
What is the password? 12345  
I don't know you.  

**or**  

What is the password? abc$123  
Welcome!
