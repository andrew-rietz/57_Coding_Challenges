## 05 -- Simple Math
You'll often write program that deal with numbers. And
depending on the programming language you use, you'll
have to convert the inputs you get to numerical data
types.

Write a program that prompts for two numbers. Print
the sum, difference, product, and quotient of those
numbers as shown in the example output

#### Example Output
What is the first number? 10

What is the second number? 5

10 + 5 = 15

10 - 5 = 5

10 * 5 = 50

10 / 5 = 2
